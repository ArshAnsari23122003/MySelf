# Sorting Visualizer

An interactive web application that visually demonstrates various sorting algorithms, enhancing understanding through real-time animations.

## 🌟 Features

- **Algorithm Selection**: Visualize different sorting algorithms such as:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
  - Heap Sort
  - Counting Sort
  - Tim Sort

- **Dynamic Array Generation**: Create arrays of varying sizes with random values for sorting.

- **Speed Control**: Adjust the speed of the visualization to observe the sorting process in detail.

- **Color-Coded Visualization**:
  - Blue: Default state
  - Yellow: Elements being compared
  - Red: Elements to be swapped
  - Green: Sorted elements

- **Complexity Display**: View the time and space complexity of the selected sorting algorithm.

## 🖥️ Technologies Used

- **HTML**: Structure of the web application.
- **CSS**: Styling and layout.
- **JavaScript**: Implementation of sorting algorithms and dynamic interactions.
